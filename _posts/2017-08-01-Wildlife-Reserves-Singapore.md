Involved in project recovery, I assisted in resolving bugs and extending functionality relating to the main website. Some of the components I worked on include:

- Ticketing platform logic
- Site-wide font-scaling for mobile devices
- General alignment issues
- Contributed towards front-end task automation script to improve performance
	during development

Coordinated the git workflow for daily releases between the backend and frontend team, as well as for external vendors involved in the project.

Frontend code built with **RequireJS**, **Less**, **Pug** &amp; **Grunt**.
