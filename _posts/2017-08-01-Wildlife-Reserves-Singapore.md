Involved in project recovery, I assisted in resolving bugs and extending functionality relating to the main website. Some of the components I worked on include:

- Ticketing platform logic
- Site-wide font-scaling for mobile devices
- General alignment issues

Coordinated the git workflow for daily releases between the backend and frontend team, as well as for external vendors involved in the project.

Frontend code built with **RequireJS**, **Less**, **Pug** &amp; **Grunt**.
