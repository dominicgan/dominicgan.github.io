I built a travel blog for my Japan trip this year (2016) so that me &amp; my girlfriend could have a place to share photos of our trip with friends and family without flooding our social media feeds.

I also took this as an opportunity to play around with Jekyll, something I've always wanted to do, but never really knew where to start off from (since my portfolio is currently done up with wordpress). This provided a good opportunity to do so!

Built this site with **Jekyll**, **Gulp** & **Sass**, building upon the included Jekyll template.
