# I am a web designer and front-end developer currently employed at Balanced Consultancy/Novitee Pte Ltd. I graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2014 with a Bachelor’s Degree (Honours) in Computing, majoring in E-Commerce.

# I am passionate about designing user interfaces, in particular for websites and mobile apps. I aim to design clear and usable interfaces, and I always base my designs upon this principle. I work primarily in Photoshop, as well as in Illustrator occasionally.

# In addition to designing user interfaces, I am also highly competent in client side development, specialising in HTML, CSS, JS & PHP. I have a deep understanding of major CMS systems such as WordPress & Magento, having used them extensively in my work.

# I enjoy swimming, photography, watching football, movies and a great deal of american dramas, and collecting mechanical keyboards.
