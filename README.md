# Portfolio Site

As in title, this is my portfolio/resume site!

This site is built primarily with Jekyll/Github Pages (because free +
free semi-relevant domain name!)

## Revisions

I've had this site since **2014** and have made quite some changes over the
years, some design related, and some implementation based because who likes what
they built in the past?

Check out the releases [here](https://github.com/dominicgan/dominicgan.github.io/releases).

A general overview:

- v1.0 (2014)
  - First implemntation ever! Godawful design and colors. Didn't actually know
	  any JS back (or less/sass for the matter) so this was done up plain.
	  Horrifying to say the least. 
  - Built with foundation, a custom.css file and completely inline html with no
	  data inside.
- v2.0 (2015)
  - Complete overhaul of the website. Mostly design related, but code was still
	  pretty bad. Inline html still.. (but hey it works so..)
- v3.0 (2016)
  - Finally decided to read jekyll documentation and to my surpries there
	  actually is way more stuff that I could do with the site. Decided to
	  overhaul again, this time design + project structure to leverage more of
	  what jekyll can do.
  - Still not that good with javascript at this point, so its just jquery in a
	  custom.js file (lol).
  - Built with sass, bourbon, jquery.
- v4.0 (2017)
  - New year new site!
  - Not actually deserving of a new version number since the site design is
	  technically the same.. Changes this time around were mainly content and
	  underlying code optimization. Still jquery, but not as badly written as
	  before
- v4.0 -- present (2018)
  - Mistakes were made in the past. More code optimization! Design still remains
	  largely the same.
  - This time around the underlying js has been updated to use system.js for
	  loading component scripts when requested instead of running everything on
	  page load. Still on jquery, but looking to shift away
- Future
  - To convert this project to a reactjs based app
  - currently working on it in a separate repo, hopefully to be implemented
	  soon..
