My name is Dominic Gan (in case you missed the massive logo on the homepage, gulp!), and I am a web designer and front-end developer from Singapore. I'm currently working at ONG&ONG Group Pte Ltd as part of the software development team. I graduated from the National University of Singapore back in 2014 (wow, 2 years now!) with a Bachelor’s Degree (Honours) in Computing, majoring in E-Commerce.

I am passionate about designing user interfaces, in particular for websites and mobile apps. I aim to design clear and usable interfaces, and I base my designs upon this principle. I do enjoy coding as well, and I take pride in creating my designs in code to make them as true to what I've envisioned. 

In my free time I like to tinker and fiddle with stuff, trying to repair or mod old things – mainly my cameras/lenses as well as my collection of mechanical keyboards [(not joking!)](http://i.imgur.com/NjkYtnp.jpg). I also [enjoy photography](http://www.flickr.com/dggx) on the weekends, though I'm not that great...hah!
