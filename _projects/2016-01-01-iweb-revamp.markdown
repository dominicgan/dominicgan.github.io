Revamp of the intranet application for the ONG&ONG group of companies. Spearheaded the interface revamp, and built the front-end framework singlehandedly. Analyzed and improved the user experience of the site as part of the UI revamp. Contributed as well with regards to performance testing and consequent code refinement.

Built upon the **Bootstrap** front-end framework, with **Sass** & **Bourbon** for custom styling.

31 July: The application is currently in beta.
